# Wagman Approximate States

wagman normal

    on enter
        set alarm to 1 minute

    on alarm
        if current device start attempts < current device allowed attempts
            send start command to current device
            increment device start attempts (these things may want to be saved)
        else
            send start recover command to current device

    on device stopped
        ...

wagman start devices

    on enter
        find next not started device (save as next start device)

        if none
            change state to normal
        else
            change state to start next device

wagman start next device

    on enter
        if current device start attempts < current device allowed attempts
            send start command to current device
        else
            send start recover command to current device

    on device started
        change wagman state to start devices

wagman will hibernate

    let stop_alarm = 0

    on enter
        set alarm $stop_alarm to 30 seconds

    on alarm
        send stop event to next guest
        set alarm $stop_alarm to 30 seconds

    on environment normal
        change state to normal

wagman hibernating

    let stop_alarm = 0

    on enter
        set alarm $stop_alarm to 30 seconds

    on alarm
        send stop event to next guest
        set alarm $stop_alarm to 30 seconds

    on environment normal
        change state to normal

# Communication Layer

...will write up more shortly...

# Additional Ideas / Plan

* Keep events in a rolling log in persistent memory. This allows us to get an
approximate sense of what was going on in the node when we check it.

* The communication layer to the node can also tell devices to start / stop /
etc using this. That way all the details of timing out a start and handling a
failure are managed by the state machine and not tied up in communication logic.
