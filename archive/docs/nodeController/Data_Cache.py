""" 
    The Data Cache stores messages between the nodes and the cloud. The main function is a unix socket server. The internal and external facing communication classes connect to
    the data cache to push or pull messages. The data cache consists of two buffers, which are matrixes of queues. Each queue cooresponds to a device location and message priority within the matrix. 
    The data cache stores messages in the queues until the available memory runs out. When the number of messages exceeds the available memory, the messages queues are cleared and the messages are written to a file.
