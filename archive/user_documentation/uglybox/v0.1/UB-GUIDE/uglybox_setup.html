	<UL>
	<img src="setup_pics/alphasense.jpg" alt="Image Not Available" style="width:498px; height:885px;">	<br><br>
	<LI>Use a 6" flat black CAT6 cable to connect the AirSense to the ChemSense. Use the RJ45 jack labeled "CHEM" on the AirSense. See the top right blow-up in the image above. <br><br>
	<LI>Make sure the two switches in the ChemSense are in the AUX and ON positions. See the bottom right blow-up in the image above. <br><br>
	<LI>Attach a 3' flat blue CAT6 cable to the AirSense in the RJ45 jack labeled "LIGHT". See the top right blow-up in the image above. <br> The other end will connect to the RJ45 jack on the LightSense. <br><br>

	<UL>	

	<br><br>
	<img src="setup_pics/shield.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable"  style="width:917px; height:744px;"> 
	<br><br>

	<LI>Finally, finish the shield. First, screw the 3 long rods into the top plate of the shield. <br><br>
	<LI>Stack the 7 shield extenders onto the base plate with sensor frame attached, running the 3' flat CAT6 cable (and OPTIONAL AlphaSense USB Cable) through each hole. <br><br> 
	<LI> Slide the 3 rods into the corresponding holes in the shield extenders. Once through to the bottom, use the 3 wingnuts to secure the shield together at the bottom plate. <br><br>
        <LI> <span style="color:red">When assembling the shield, make sure the switches on the ChemSense remain in the ON / AUX positions (up / up)! </span> <br><br>
	<LI> **There may be other (and/or easier) ways to complete this step. Whichever path is chosen, make sure the CAT6 (and optional USB) cables are running out the top of the shield**

<br>
	<LI>Prepare Power Box
	<UL>
	<br><br>
	<img src="setup_pics/adaptermount.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable" style="width:484px; height:795px;">

	<br><br>
	<img src="setup_pics/powerconnections.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable" style="width:1152px; height:864px;">
	<br><br>
	<LI> Cut 2.5' of two-conductor 18AWG wire, and strip 3/4" of outer tubing on both ends. <br> 2.5' may be too long, so feel free to trim it down later in the assembly. <br><br>
	<LI>Attach the wire rope clamp to the smaller of the two holes in the box. First, slide the rubber o-ring over the end of the clamp. <br> Then insert the threaded end into the hole, leaving the rope clamp portion on the outside of the box. <br> Finally, screw on the nut on the inside of the box, securing the rope clamp in place. <br><br>
	<LI> Next, prepare the female power plug. First, slide the 7/8" o-ring onto the end of the power plug, as shown in the top left blow-up in the image above. <br> Slide the Black, White, and Green wires through the hole, and then slide the 1/2" steel conduit lock-nut over the wires on the inside of the box. <br> Secure the plug by screwing the lock-nut onto the threaded end of the plug. <br><br>
	<LI>Connect all the wires to the power converter. With at least 1/4" conductor exposed of each wire, connect the wires in the following order, left to right: <br> power plug(Black, White, Green), two-conductor wire(Black, Red). Confirm the connections with the top right blow-up in the image above.

	<img src="setup_pics/power.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable" style="width:885px; height:498px;">
	<br><br>
	<LI> Finally, mount the power converter into the plastic box. Tuck the Black, White, and Green power plug wires beneath the riser. <br> Gently pull the two-conductor wire through the clamp to get rid of slack inside the box. <br><br>
	<LI> Once the riser fits snugly, attach it to the box using 4 1/4" phillips thread-forming screws.

	<LI>Mount the node in the Ugly Box
	<UL>
	<br><br>
	<img src="setup_pics/ublid.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable" style="width:997px; height:814px;">
	<br><br>
	<LI> First, assemble the nose component for the lid. Use double sided tape and attach a piece of foam onto the bottom of the nose. <br> Also, use the metal nose as a guide to cut out a rubber seal for the nose. Make three holes in the rubber in alignment with the holes in the metal nose. <br> Then, cut a vertical slit roughly 3/4" long in the center of the rubber piece. <br><br>
	<LI> Run the flat blue ethernet cable, power cable, and OPTIONAL AlphaSense USB cable through the hole in the lid, and through the slit in the rubber seal. <br><br>
	<LI> Line the rubber seal up with the holes in the lid, and then place the metal nose with foam on top of the seal and wires. <br> Use 3 M2x20 screws to attach the metal nose and seal to the lid. Secure the screws on the underside of the lid with 3 3/8" spacers and 3 M2 hex nuts. <br> Use the images above as a guide.

	<br><br>
	<img src="setup_pics/boxinstall1.jpg" alt="Image Unavailable" style="width:1137px; height:485px;">
	<br><br>
	<LI>Using 4 1/4" phillips threadforming screws, mount the node into the box, inserting the screws through the holes in the acrylic legs and into the holes in the box. <br><br>
	<LI>Once in place, adjust the cameras so they are centered in the domes, and moved as close the the dome as possible. <br><br>
	<LI>Connect a short CAT6 cable to an Ethernet-to-USB cable. Plug the USB end into the C1+, and the other end into the female RJ45 jack inside the box. <br><br>
	<LI> Connect the wires from the nose to the node. The flat blue ethernet cable connects to the RJ45 jack in the LightSense. <br> The OPTIONAL AlphaSense USB connects to the remaining USB port on the C1+. <br> Lastly, connect the power cable to the Wagman power port (see bottom right in the image above). The black wire should be connected to the hole closest to the C1+.
