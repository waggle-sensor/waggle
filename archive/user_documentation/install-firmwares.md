## Wagman firmware installation
In order to manage nodecontroller and extension_node, wagman has to run its management program. Download the latest firmware [here](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/Wagman/wagman_init_20150517.zip) to your computer.

Unzip the firmware:

```bash
unzip <file-name>
# if you do not have unzip, install it using sudo apt-get install unzip
```

Install avrdude to upload the firmware:

```bash
sudo apt-get install avrdude
```

Connect microUSB-USB cable to wagman with the computer. Important: If you are using a virtual machine, then be sure the USB cable is connected to the machine. You can do so by finding the removable devices menu on the machine and you should see the USB there. </br>

Run install.sh. You need to be the root user to run the script. When the script is executed, you should see a green light and red/orange flashing light for a few seconds. After that is done, the C1+ should start up after about 15 seconds and the XU4 should start up after about 90 seconds.

```bash
cd wagman_init
./install.sh
```

## Nodecontroller and extension_node firmware installation

**WARNING: before procceding the following steps, pull out wagman's power adapter plug.

Follow the instruction [here](./copy_waggle_image_to_memory_card.md) to upload the latest version of both nodecontroller and extension_node firmware. As a result, you will have two micro SD cards for both devices, respectively.

Insert each micro SD card on the designated device (nodecontroller firmware for nodecontroller and extension_node firmware for extension_node). eMMC card should also be inserted on both devices.
