# WagMan

## port 1 (C1+ nodecontroller)
- see C1+ connections

## port 2  (XU4 extension node)
- see XU4 connections

## port 3 (LightSense)
- WagMan port 3 slots 2-4 to LightSense friction mount slots 2-4 (slot 1 on the right side is marked with a little circle on the board; slot 1 would refer to reset, we are not using this) <br>
color coding of wires if applicable:
```text
1. gray  -> reset
2. red   -> 5V
3. white -> heartbeat
4. black -> gnd
```
Switch on the LightSense below friction mount has to switched inside.


- WagMan/battery thermistor to port 3 (slots 5 and 6)


## port 4
- metal frame thermistor to port 4 (slots 5 and 6)

## port5
- AC/DC thermistor to port 5 (slots 5 and 6)

## power
- AC/DC converter: <br>
     WagMan J10 friction mount: AC/DC -V to Wagman J10 ground (the one next to the power barrel connector) ; +V to WagMan J10 5V<br>
     alternative, if available: WagMan barrel connector

# C1+ connections

## USB connections

- C1+ USB to Lightsense micro USB using aluminium USB cable (which one exactly?)
- C1+ USB to WagMan micro USB using normal USB cable (right angle USB cable)
- C1+ USB to microUSB/RJ45-adapter ("CAT6 USB BKT1") using normal USB cable (which one exactly?)
- C1+ USB to ?

## plain wires
- Heartbeat: C1+ GPIO pin 3 to WagMan port 1, slot 3 (slot 1 is right most)
- SRE J9 to C1+ GPIO pins 39 and 27 (order does not matter) (SRE is the little device plugged on top of the WagMan next to the C1+) 

## power
- power: C1+ power barrel socket to WagMan port 1 ( 5V (slot 2) and ground (slot 4) ) using barrel connector wire (2.5mm outer diameter)

# XU4 connections

## USB connections
- XU4 USB (2-port USB) to camera (LightSense, non-coated camera) using camera wire
- XU4 USB (2-port USB) to microUSB/RJ45-adapter ("CAT6 USB BKT1"), outer micro USB (the one closest to XU4 USB slots) using aluminium USB cable
- XU4 USB (1-port USB) to microUSB/RJ45-adapter ("CAT6 USB BKT1"), outer micro USB (on other side, the one farthest away from XU4 USB slots) using normal USB cable


## Ethernet
- C1+ RJ45 to XU4 RJ45 using ethernet cable

## plain wires
- Heartbeat: XU4 GPIO pin 4 to WagMan port 2, slot 3 (slot 1 is right most)
- Bootselector: XU4 bootselector eMMC to WagMan J4 right slot, XU4 bootselector uSD to WagMan J4 left slot, XU4 bootselector common (middle) to WagMan J4 middle slot

## power
- power: XU4 power barrel socket to WagMan port 2 ( 5V (slot 2) and ground (slot 4) ) using barrel connector wire (5.5mm outer diameter)

# CoreSense
- LightSense is id connected to C1+, see above
- LightSense RJ45 to AirSense RJ45 using ethernet cable (which one exactly?)
- AirSense RJ45 to ChemSeense RJ45 using ethernet cable (which one exactly?)

# Serial connection
- C1+ UART CON5
- XU4 UART CON1


# USB Breakouts
Comment: CAT6 USB BKT1 and CAT6 USB BKT2 are extending USB ports of the C1+ and XU4 to attach devices (modem, camera, particle sensor) located in the Stevenson shield. The two outer USB cables connect to the XU4, while the inner two connect to the C1+. The two breakouts are connected with each other using two Ethernet cables.

- CAT6 USB BKT1 to CAT6 USB BKT2 using CAT6 Ethernet cable (one-to-one mapping JP1-JP1 and JP2-JP2)<br>
JP1 on CAT6 USB BKT1 is the one closer to the Odroid C1+.

# CAT6 USB BKT2
- CAT6 USB BKT2 J1 to coated camera 
- CAT6 USB BKT2 J2 to modem
- CAT6 USB BKT2 J3 to ?? (particle sensor ?)
- CAT6 USB BKT2 J4 to microphone

# Conexel-UART console cable
- Long end of the UART wire goes into the XU4, the short end into the C1+. The conexel 8-pin goes through the hole in the cover of the box.
