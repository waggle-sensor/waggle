# Waggle boot-ups

Plug on wagman's power adapter. Within several seconds, 'ALIVE' LED of nodecontroller will be blinking. At the first time of booting the two devices will be rebooting automatically. If nodecontroller is succesfully booted and wagman confirms it, then wagman will power up extension_node using the same method. Please wait until 'ALIVE' LEDs of both devices are blinking. And then, you should be able to connect to nodecontroller:
[SSH connection.md](./SSH_connection.md).

Follow the instruction:
[Configure nodecontroller](./getting_started.md#configure-node-controller-software)
