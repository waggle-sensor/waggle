Description: ==========
        Hypothesis
        ==========
        
        Hypothesis is a library for testing your Python code against a much larger range
        of examples than you would ever want to write by hand. It's based on the Haskell
        library, Quickcheck, and is designed to integrate seamlessly into your existing
        Python unit testing work flow.
        
        Hypothesis is both extremely practical and also advances the state of the art of
        unit testing by some way. It's easy to use, stable, and extremely powerful. If
        you're not using Hypothesis to test your project then you're missing out.
