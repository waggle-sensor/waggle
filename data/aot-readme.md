## AoT Data Archive

Historic Data from the Chicago AoT nodes are available for download and analysis. The data *will not be updated anymore* as the Chicago [AoT project has reached EOL](http://arrayofthings.github.io/). The final archive can be obtained from this [link](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/datasets/index.php).
