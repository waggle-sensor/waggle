## Data

Data from pilot Sage and Waggle Nodes is available through [API and downloadable archives](https://sagecontinuum.github.io/sage-docs/docs/tutorials/accessing-data).


## AoT Data Archive

Historic Data from the Chicago AoT nodes are available for download and analysis. The data *will not be updated anymore* as the Chicago [AoT project has reached EOL](http://arrayofthings.github.io/). The final archive can be obtained from this [link](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/waggle/downloads/datasets/index.php). More information on the data bundle can be obtained from the [data README](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/waggle/edit/master/data/aot-readme.md).
