# State Machine Design

My current plan is to implement a tiny event-driven state machine on the
Wagman. There will be a state machine instance for the Wagman, node controller,
and any guest nodes. These exist independently (in order to make sure each
device is able to safely bring it's corresponding piece of hardware through
a correct power up / power down / etc process). The Wagman state machine plays
the special role of telling these devices to start / stop / etc.

The core of this machine is simple and basic functionality like being able to
say things like "after x seconds trigger an event" are built-into to it. This
simplifies things like waiting for heartbeats or timeouts.

As we develop communication and logging, these systems can tie into this core
to do things like: send devices start / stop events, place last n events into
a rolling log stored in persistent memory, etc.

This all clearly separates the device logic from the hardware layer which may
change over time. (For example, we may decide to use heartbeat pins which
support interrupts.) It also makes it easier to move towards something like a
"sleep for a while, turn on, do some updates, sleep again" style design like we
talked about with the eventual low power Wagman.

## Node Controller / Guest Node Approximate States

device starting
    enum { timeout_alarm }

    on enter
        set alarm timeout_alarm to 120 seconds
        turn on power to guest port

    on alarm
        broadcast start failed
        change state to stopped

    on heartbeat
        change state to started

    on stop
        ignore or change state to stopping / restart?
        how should we handle this kind of thing?
        change state to will_stop

    on restart
        ignore or change state to stopping / restart?
        how should we handle this kind of thing?

device stopping
    enum { timeout_alarm, heartbeat_alarm }

    on enter
        set alarm timeout_alarm to 10 minutes
        set alarm heartbeat_alarm to 1 minute
        send shutdown message to device

    on heartbeat
        set alarm heartbeat_alarm to 1 minute
        send shutdown message to device

    on alarm $timeout_alarm (cannot seem to kill device)
        broadcast stop failed
        turn off device power
        change state to stopped

    on alarm $heartbeat_alarm (no heartbeat for at least 30 seconds)
        turn off device power
        change state to stopped

    on start
    on restart
        change state to restarting?

device started
    enum { heartbeat_alarm }

    on enter
        broadcast device started
        set alarm heartbeat_alarm to 5 minutes

    on heartbeat
        set alarm heartbeat_alarm to 5 minutes

    on alarm
        broadcast event lost heartbeat
        change state to stopping

    on do_start
        broadcast device started

    on do_stop
        change state to stopping

    on do_restart
        change state to restarting

device stopped (maybe make default state?)

    on enter
        broadcast stopped

    on start
    on restart
        change state to starting

    on stop
        broadcast event device stopped

    on heartbeat
        change state to started?

device restarting

    on enter
        send device restart message

## Wagman Approximate States

wagman normal

    on enter
        set alarm to 1 minute

    on alarm
        change state to start next device

    on environment warn?
        change state to start hibernate

wagman start next device

    on enter
        get next start priority device which is not started

        if current device start attempts < current device allowed attempts
            send start event to current device
        else
            send start recover event to current device

    on device started
        change wagman state to normal

    on device start failed
        increment device fail attempts
        change wagman state to start next device

wagman will hibernate

    let stop_alarm = 0

    on enter
        set alarm $stop_alarm to 30 seconds

    on alarm
        send stop event to next guest
        set alarm $stop_alarm to 30 seconds

    on environment normal
        change state to normal

wagman hibernating

    let stop_alarm = 0

    on enter
        set alarm $stop_alarm to 30 seconds

    on alarm
        send stop event to next guest
        set alarm $stop_alarm to 30 seconds

    on environment normal
        change state to normal

One nice thing about this spec is that it translates into code pretty much
as is. Here are a few examples:

void nc_starting(Device *device, const Event *event)
{
    enum { ALARM_TIMEOUT = 0 };

    switch (event->type)
    {
        case EVENT_ENTER:
            set_alarm(device, ALARM_TIMEOUT, MINUTES(2));
            // power on device
            break;
        case EVENT_ALARM:
            broadcast_event(device, EVENT_START_FAILED);
            change_state(device, nc_stopping);
            break;
        case EVENT_HEARTBEAT:
            change_state(device, nc_started);
            break;
    }
}

void nc_stopping(Device *device, const Event *event)
{
    enum { ALARM_TIMEOUT = 0, ALARM_HEARTBEAT = 1 };

    switch (event->type)
    {
        case EVENT_ENTER:
            set_alarm(device, ALARM_TIMEOUT, MINUTES(10));
            set_alarm(device, ALARM_HEARTBEAT, MINUTES(1));
            // send device shutdown message...if supports...?
            break;
        case EVENT_HEARTBEAT:
            set_alarm(device, ALARM_HEARTBEAT, MINUTES(1));
            // send device shutdown message...if supports...?
            break;
        case EVENT_ALARM:
            if (event->data.alarm == ALARM_TIMEOUT)
                broadcast_event(device, EVENT_STOP_FAILED);
            // kill power to device
            change_state(device, nc_stopped);
            break;
    }
}

void nc_started(Device *device, const Event *event)
{
    enum { ALARM_HB = 0 };

    switch (event->type)
    {
        case EVENT_ENTER:
            broadcast_event(device, EVENT_STARTED);
            set_alarm(device, ALARM_HB, MINUTES(5));
            break;
        case EVENT_HEARTBEAT:
            set_alarm(device, ALARM_HB, MINUTES(5));
            break;
        case EVENT_ALARM:
            broadcast_event(device, EVENT_LOST_HEARTBEAT);
            change_state(device, nc_stopping);
            break;
        case EVENT_START:
            broadcast_event(device, EVENT_STARTED);
            break;
        case EVENT_STOP:
            change_state(device, nc_stopping);
            break;
        case EVENT_RESTART:
            change_state(device, nc_restarting);
            break;
    }
}

# Communication Layer

...will write up more shortly...

# Additional Ideas / Plan

* Keep events in a rolling log in persistent memory. This allows us to get an
approximate sense of what was going on in the node when we check it.

* The communication layer to the node can also tell devices to start / stop /
etc using this. That way all the details of timing out a start and handling a
failure are managed by the state machine and not tied up in communication logic.
