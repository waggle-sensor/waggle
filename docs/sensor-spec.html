    <h1>Integrating Sensors with the Waggle Platform</h1>

    <p>The purpose of this document is to describe the hardware and software
    requirements a sensor must meet to be used with the Waggle platform.</p>

    <h2>Size and Assembly</h2>

    <p>Space inside a typical Waggle node may be limited. For example, an Array of Things
    node provides a rectangular volume of size 45mm x 64mm x 75mm inside of the
    outer shield for a sensor. A mounting plate is provided with four M3 sized
    (3mm diameter) holes available for securing a sensor. The top of the backplate
    extrudes forward slightly leaving about 5mm of top clearance.</p>

    <h2>Interfaces</h2>

    <p>There are a number of options for connecting a sensor. The main interfaces
    include a USB connection directly to our guest module and I2C, SPI, RS232 though
    our coresense board. Ethernet or WiFi could be used in a customized node but are
    not currently being used for sensors in any Waggle node.</p>

    <p>The preferred option is to use USB (for example, serial over USB) which
    simplifies your task to only writing the node and server side plugin pair.</p>

    <p>Interfaces which use the coresense can be used but require the development
    of firmware code adhering to the rather stringent coresense packet format. Since
    all processing will occur through the coresense, this also means you have less
    control over what happens to your data as it moves through the pipeline.</p>

    <h2>Power</h2>

    <p>Depending on which interface is used, your sensor must adhere to the following power constraints.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using USB: 0.5A at 5V ???</li>
      <li>Using coresense: ... ???</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network</h2>

    <p>A typical Waggle node may have limited network bandwidth. For example,
    the Array of Things nodes are all transmitting over a wireless modem, which
    is somewhat limited in both speed and available data usage. These are
    important considerations when deciding on the both the rate and volume of
    data intended to be transmitted. Our suggestion is to restrict the rate to
    at most one message to be sent every 10 seconds and that the message size is
    at most 1K.</p>

    <h2>Software</h2>

    <p>Once a sensor is sized and fitted to be used in a node it will need at least
    a node and server side plugin pair and possibly coresense firmware if a non-USB
    interface option was used. The node side plugin needs to read data from
    the sensor and prepare it to be pushed to the server. The server side plugin
    handles any post-processing which needs to occur on the transmitted data from
    the node side plugin. In addition, these should be designed with fault tolerance
    in mind in case a network carrier or server may go down. A node will take care
    of queuing up data in these circumstances but one should be prepared to handle
    a delayed data stream correctly.</p>

    <p>The exact details are described in more detail in our plugin development
    document but we provide a brief example of what each piece may be responsible
    for.</p>

    <h3>Example: Coresense</h3>

    <p>The coresense is a PCB containing a collection of many different sensors.
    It periodically sends a binary packet over a USB serial port containing
    readings from each of the onboard sensors. The node side plugin reads this
    packet from the serial port, checks it for validity and then sends it as-is
    to the server. The server side plugin takes this packet, decodes the various
    readings from it and forwards it further down the server side data pipeline.</p>
